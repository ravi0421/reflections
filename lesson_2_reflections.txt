What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The repository is set to be added to Git. This is necessary so that we can start pushing our code on Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is where the files reside before moving to repository.
	Working Directory is where the files are. It may or may not be related to staging area.
 	Staging area allows us to review the files before being committed. Thus, it reduces any discrepancy.
