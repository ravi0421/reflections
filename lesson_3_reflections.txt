When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When we are working from multiple remote locations as a part of team or even when we use different machines individually.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Manually pulling the changes prevents missing the updates done on local being outdone by pull from remote. Plus, there should be meaningfull merging of branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork happens when we clone repository from another GITHUB account to our own account.
	Clone is about copying a repository from our own repository to another of repository on our own GIT account. It could also be cloning from one folder to another on our system.
	Branches are the nodes created when we work on our local copy in our machine.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	We can then merge the two files after resolving conflicts between different versions stored locally.
